# DoS payloads (one-shot runners)

This folder provides minimal scripts to replay each DoS class against the sample target. Each payload runs once, reports the response, and then waits for you to press Enter so you can bring the server back up before proceeding to the next one.

## Usage
```
cd dos-examples
PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH" node run-dos-examples.js http://127.0.0.1:3005/test
```

Cases covered:
- recursive refs ($R0 self-ref)
- malformed rows/shapes
- response confusion crash
- header matrix crash (text/plain, default Accept, Next-Action set)
- encoding crash (NUL)
- type-confusion array

Note: These will crash the target; you will need to restart it between cases when prompted.
