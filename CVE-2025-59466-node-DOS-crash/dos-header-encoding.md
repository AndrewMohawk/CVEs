## Title
DoS: Header/encoding validation crashes

## Description
Crafted headers and malformed bodies (NUL/surrogate) cause the server to crash before or early in Flight decoding.

## Impact
High – low-effort requests drop the server. Observed on Next.js 16.0.7 sample app (`/test`).

## Reproduction steps
1) Discover a current action ID (42-char hex starting with `40`).
2) Send one of:
   - Header matrix: body `["$R0"]` with `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8`, default Accept, and `Next-Action: <ACTION_ID>` (variant omitting Next-Action also crashes).
   - Encoding: body `["$R0\u0000"]` or `["$R0\ud800"]` with the same headers.
3) Observe the server becomes unresponsive (health probe fails).
