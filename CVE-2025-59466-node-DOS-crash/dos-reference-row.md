## Title
DoS: Reference/row resolution crash

## Description
Unvalidated reference resolution and row shapes allow self/forward/cyclic refs and malformed rows to drive the decoder into unbounded recursion/stack overflow.

## Impact
High – single request drops the server (health-down/stack overflow). Observed on Next.js 16.0.7 sample app (`/test`).

## Reproduction steps
1) Discover a current action ID (42-char hex starting with `40`).
2) Send one of the payloads as `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8`, `Accept: text/x-component`, `Next-Action: <ACTION_ID>`:
   - Self-ref: `["$R0"]`
   - Malformed row: `[{"id":0,"type":"$R0"}]`
   - Forward/cycle: `["$R2","$R1","$R0"]` or dense chain of `$R0`
   - Type-confusion array: `["$F1", {"wrap":"$R0"}, ["$L0","$F1"]]`
3) Observe the server become unresponsive (health probe fails).
